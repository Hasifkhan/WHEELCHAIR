SMART WHEEL CHAIR 
Smart Wheel Chairs are mechanically driven vehicles that can move on their own at the user's command. As a result, using a wheelchair requires less force and human effort from the user. Additionally, it gives those who are physically or visually challenged the chance to transfer from one location to another. A system for detecting obstacles is also included with the wheelchair, lowering the possibility of an accident while traveling. Although modern advances in science and technology have fundamentally altered how the average individual lives his life, some groups of people have not been able to profit from these advancements. People with disabilities, in especially those with restricted mobility, continue to lead terrible lives. A smart wheel chair tries to help those who are physically disabled and handicapped by giving them some form of mobility that would be very beneficial to them. A key controller component of a smart wheelchair enables the user to input data using a joystick, an accelerometer, or voice commands. The controller unit then interprets the instruction and executes the necessary maneuvers to transfer the wheelchair to the designated location.
